        Enrique Bran is a creative graphic designer student at SJSU. 
        Enrique chose to take digital media to expand his knowledge by using his creativity. 
        Throughout his life, he always enjoyed drawing since he was only 10 years old. 
        Back in 2017, his cousin was shot and killed which was a very difficult time for him and his family. 
        Enrique wanted to explore new talents of his own and eventually, he did. 
        3 years ago, Enrique was a background actor for a Netflix series. 
        A year later, Enrique realized that he had a passion for making music since both his mother and father love to sing. 
        Enrique never gave up and always puts his best foot forward. In his free time, he creates music and draws portraits of others as a stress reliever. 
        The first-ever portrait he finished was a black and white portrait of his cousin shown below. Because of his cousin, Enrique is more motivated than ever to follow his dreams.
